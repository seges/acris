#summary Annotation processors mutable API
#labels PAP,MutableAPI

= Purpose/goal =

Mutable API is used to:
 * represent types that is going to be generated (so does not exists on the classpath yet)
 * easier modification of the existing types
 * manipulate with the objects instead of string representations while generating classes
 * handle complex situations when more yet non-existing types should be interconnected

== "Mutable" API provided by JSR 269 by default ==

Although TypeMirrors and Elements are not mutable (no setter are available) you still can create types using methods from javax.lang.model.util.Types class:
 * {{{ WildcardType getWildcardType(TypeMirror extendsBound, TypeMirror superBound); }}} allows you to create "custom" wildcard type like: ? extends Serializable
 * {{{ DeclaredType getDeclaredType(TypeElement typeElem, TypeMirror... typeArgs); }}} allows you to use declared type with specified type variablest, like Map<? extends Serializable, String>

== So, what's the problem? ==

Problem is when you reach the world outside of the simple processors and want to handle more complex situations:
 * create type variable with defined variable name, like {{{ <T extends Serializable> }}} - you simply can't represent variable 'T' using the standard API
 * use type variables with the declared types like {{{ PagedResult<T extends List<User>> }}} - you can't also use it in the types
 * work with classes that does not exists yet because they are going to be generated

== Mutable types ==

Green types from from standard PAP types are mutable.
