= Possibilities =

There are possibilities to control:
  * visibility
  * enable

by calling methods on BindingActions object available from *alter* method. You can set up the condition against a field of a bean either by using predefined methods:
  * isNotNull
  * isNotEmpty
  * equalTo
  * ...

or by implementing custom condition applied through calling *matches* method.
