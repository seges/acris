= Intructions =

We are using free deployment environment for Java application provided by Google App engine on acris-gwt.appspot.com. If you are acris developer just commit your changes and email notification will be delivered to you.

If you want to set-up SVN mail notifications on your own, follow the next steps:
  * install GEP and GAE (instalation guide is here: http://code.google.com/intl/sk-SK/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/installing.html)
  * download sources from 
{{{https://acris.googlecode.com/svn/branches/svn-post-commit}}}
  * generate eclipse project using maven (command: mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse)
  * copy project dependencies to the war/WEB-INF/lib directory (command: dependency:copy-dependencies)
  * import your project into the eclipse workspace
  * create settings.properties (you can use example settings file settings.properties_example)
    ** from property - SVN notification emails sender (have to be validated google account email address added to the App Engine project environment)
    ** to property - SVN notification emails recepients
    ** authentication - enter your Post-Commit Authentication Key generated by google

= Running and deploying project =

  * enable Google App Engine support to your project

  * create GAE launcher (add VM argument: {{{-javaagent:<APP_ENGINE>\lib\agent\appengine-agent.jar for GAE version 1.2.6+}}})
[http://acris.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/svnhook_gep_launcher.PNG]
  * Now you can locally run and test application using created launcher 
  * Deploy the application

= Configure SVN post commit hook =
  * enter URL of your deployed SVN hook (in our case http://acris-gwt.appspot.com/svnhook)
[http://acris.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/svnhook_configuration.png]
  * now each SVN commit should produce new email in your mailbox :)
  * 2000 mails per day should be send by Google App Engine (see quota info http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html)
