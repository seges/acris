#summary Selenium CI

= Maven integration =

|| *Task* || *Maven command* || *Decription* ||
|| *Eclipse integration* || mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse || This creates you eclipse based project with all settings required for annotation processor including the .factorypath, .org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core.prefs, .etc. *This command does not execute processors anymore!* ||
|| *Executing processors* || mvn processor:process processor:process-tests || This executes processor against the java sources and against the test sources ||
|| *Install selenium project* || mvn clean install -!DskipTests || Executes available annotation processors and installs JAR with all the test classes (with suffix -tests.jar) ||
|| *Executing tests* || mvn test || Execute tests with default configuration ||

= Executing processors =

Processors are executed in 2 ways:
 * in the manual way using `mvn processor:process processor:process-tests` command or
 * in the automatic way using `mvn install` command

_Note: if do not want to execute processors against the test source just skip the processor:process-tests (= use only mvn processor:process) command or skip tests using -Dmaven.test.skip parameter._

= Install selenium project =

This allows you to reuse selenium common classes/tests in more project. Just install the project using `mvn clean install` _(or mvn clean install -!DskipTests if you don't want to execute tests during the installation)_ command and dependency to your new project:

{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>__YOUR_GROUP_ID__</groupId>
	<artifactId>__YOUR_ARTIFACT_ID__</artifactId>
	<version>__VERSION__</version>
	<type>test-jar</type>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
}}}

= Executing tests =

Tests can be executed using `mvn test` command using default configuration listend in the SuiteRunner:
