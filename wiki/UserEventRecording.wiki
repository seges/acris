#summary RPC mechanism for recording user events (mouse, keyboard and html events) and storing them in the database in optimized form
#labels EventRecording,HTMLEvent,MouseEvent,KeyboardEvent

= Introduction =

With GWT version 1.7 is now very easy to record/store user events (in GWT 1.7 were GWT handlers introduced) and then identify this events and replay user actions step by step. What is this good for?
 * You can much more easier reproduce user steps without any performance side effects
   * Mouse events - click, move, over, out, ...
   * Keyboard events - keydown, keypress, keyup
   * HTML events - blur, focus, scroll, context menu
 * You can see what exactly (and how long) users are doing on your GWT site or GWT application
 * You can record specific events and then play this events to the users 
 * Great base for testing platform for your application - like selenium testing framework

This all features are included in acris-recorder projects.

= User event catching =

You can easily catch every user action represented as browser event using NativePreviewHandler like this:
{{{
NativePreviewHandler nativePreviewHandler = new NativePreviewHandler(){
   public void onPreviewNativeEvent(NativePreviewEvent event) {
        Event gwtevent = Event.as(event.getNativeEvent());
        if (MouseEvent.isCorrectEvent(gwtevent)) {
       fireListeners(new MouseEvent(gwtevent));
        } else if (KeyboardEvent.isCorrectEvent(gwtevent)) {
        fireListeners(new KeyboardEvent(gwtevent));
        } else if (HtmlEvent.isCorrectEvent(gwtevent)) {
        fireListeners(new HtmlEvent(gwtevent));
        }
   }
};
Event.addNativePreviewHandler(nativePreviewHandler);
}}}

HTML event
    * HTML event (represents most simpliest browser event) consists from:
          o TargetID - jednoznacny identifikator HTML elementu, ktoreho sa dany event tyka
          o Type - typ HTML eventu:
                + ONBLUR (type = 0)
                + ONCHANGE (type = 1)
                + ONCONTEXTMENU (type = 2)
                + ONERROR (type = 3)
                + ONFOCUS (type = 4)
                + ONLOAD (type = 5)
                + ONSCROLL (type = 6)
